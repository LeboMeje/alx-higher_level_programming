# Javascript - Objects, Scopes and and Closures
Project done during [**Full-Stack software engineering**] studies at [**ALX SE School**]. It aims to teach & learn about object-oriented programming, classes & constructors, inheritance, closures(lexical scoping)/lexical environment & scopes(block scope, function scope, global scope).

## Technologies
* Tested on Ubuntu **20.04 LTS**
* Javascripts are written using node js(`version 14.x`)
* Files are semistandard compliant
