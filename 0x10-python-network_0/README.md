# Python - Network #0
Project done during  **Full Stack Software-engineering** studies at **ALX SE School**. It aims to learn about `HTTP`,`URL`,`TCP` & how the server interpretes the request received from the client user.

## Technologies
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Python scripts compiled using Python3 (version 3.8.5)
* Bash scripts interpreted using Bash 4.8.4
